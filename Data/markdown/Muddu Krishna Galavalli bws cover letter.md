Hiring Manager
BWSolution GmbH
Subject: Application for Junior Project Manager Position
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am excited to apply for the Junior Project Manager position at BWSolution GmbH. With a strong
background in AI-driven project execution, cross-functional team leadership, and process
optimization, I am eager to bring my expertise to support CarLiner’s digital transformation initiatives.
In my current role as an AI Engineer at Foviatech GmbH, I successfully managed a €100,000 AI-based
vehicle inspection project, ensuring a 91% agreement with manual inspection. My experience in
deploying scalable solutions, leading workshops, and collaborating with stakeholders has honed my
ability to drive projects efficiently. Additionally, my tenure at Stryker GmbH strengthened my
expertise in technical training, data-driven decision-making, and structured project execution.
I am highly organized, thrive in dynamic environments, and have a hands-on approach to problem-
solving. My proficiency with Microsoft Office, Agile methodologies, and customer-centric project
execution aligns well with the responsibilities of this role. I am particularly excited about the
opportunity to work closely with dealerships, enhancing sales processes and driving operational
success.
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your needs.
Please feel free to contact me at your convenience.
Best regards,
Muddu Krishna Galavalli
